Tools:
EventBridge
Lambda
EC2 Security Groups
Boto3 SDK for AWS
Moto library (http://docs.getmoto.org/en/latest/)

Task:
Build a function that remediates Security Group rules that open port 22 or port 3389 to the CIDR 0.0.0.0/0

Security group:
boto3 docs - working with security groups in Amazon EC2

Create unit tests as listed below using the Moto library
http://docs.getmoto.org/en/latest/docs/services/ec2.html

Remediation Action:
Revoke the offending rule only

Invocation:
Lambda should be invoked and perform the check each time a security group is created or changed (Eventbridge)

Tests to Perform:
Create new security group rule with Port 22 open to 0.0.0.0/0 - rule should be revoked

Create new security group rule with Port 3389 open to 0.0.0.0/0 - rule should be revoked

Create new security group rule with Port 22 open to 10.0.0.0/8 - rule should not be modified or revoked

Create new security group rule with Port 3389 open to 10.0.0.0/8 - rule should not be modified or revoked

Create new security group with rule that has Port 22 open to 0.0.0.0/0 - rule should be revoked

Create new security group with rule that has Port 3389 open to 0.0.0.0/0 - rule should be revoked

Create new security group with rule that has Port 22 open to 10.0.0.0/8 - rule should not be modified or revoked

Create new security group with rule that has Port 3389 open to 10.0.0.0/8 - rule should not be modified or revoked

Create new security group rule with Port 22 open to 0.0.0.0/0 in Security Group with a non-offending rule - rule should be revoked but non-offending rule should not be changed

Create new security group rule with Port 3389 open to 0.0.0.0/0 in Security Group with a non-offending rule (10.0.0.0/8) - rule should be revoked but non-offending rule should not be changed

Create new security group rule with Port 22 open to 10.0.0.0/8 in Security Group with existing non-offending rule (10.0.0.0/8) - no rule should not be modified or revoked

Create new security group rule with Port 3389 open to 10.0.0.0/8 in Security Group with existing non-offending rule (10.0.0.0/8) - no rule should not be modified or revoked

Create new security group with rule that has Port 22 open to 0.0.0.0/0 and another rule with Port 22 open to 10.0.0.0/8 - only the 0.0.0.0/0 rule should be revoked

Create new security group with rule that has Port 3389 open to 0.0.0.0/0 and another rule with Port 22 open to 10.0.0.0/8  - only the 0.0.0.0/0 rule should be revoked

Create new security group with rule that has Port 22 open to 10.0.0.0/8 and another rule with Port 3389 open to 10.0.0.0/8  - no rules should be modified or revoked

Next Steps:
Consider how you would improve this solution - 

Could you make it only authorize certain IPs (e.g. a list of Deloitte VPN CIDRs)?

Can you branch to cover all ports except 80 and 443?

How would you handle exceptions? Account level, Security Group level? Where is the optimal level to have them?

What if we're onboarding an existing account and want to scan for these but not remediate? How could you alter the solution efficiently for this "read-only" scan?

What shortcomings exist if this is our only scan for Security Groups?
